This is regression analysis project that is conducted when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

* Checking that the target variable is binary
* Checking and taking care of missing values in the dataset
* Converting categorical variables to a dummy indicator
* Checking for independence between features
* Checking that the dataset size is sufficient
* Deploying and evaluating logisticRegression model
* Model Evaluation Classification report without cross-validation
* K-fold cross-validation & confusion matri* Make a test prediction
